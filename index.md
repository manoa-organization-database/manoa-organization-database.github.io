## Overview

The Manoa Organization Database (MOD) is a web application that functions as a catalog for the various student clubs operating in UH Manoa. Club leaders are able to provide information about their clubs such as descriptions, meeting times and locations, contact information, among others. Students can search for clubs according to their interests, as well as being notified when a club matching their interests is created.
